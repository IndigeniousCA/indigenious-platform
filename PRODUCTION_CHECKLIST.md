# üö® PRODUCTION LAUNCH CHECKLIST - September 30, 2025

## CRITICAL PATH (Must Have by Sept 30)

### 1. ‚úÖ Core Services Required
- [ ] **Authentication Service** - User login/registration
- [ ] **Business Service** - Company profiles & verification  
- [ ] **RFQ Service** - Post/browse/bid on opportunities
- [ ] **Payment Service** - Stripe integration for subscriptions

### 2. üî¥ Database Setup (BLOCKING)
```bash
# Need to run immediately:
cd /Users/Jon/Desktop/Unations/indigenious-microservices/indigenous-platform

# 1. Setup production Supabase
npx supabase init
npx supabase db push --db-url "YOUR_PRODUCTION_DB_URL"

# 2. Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. üî¥ Environment Configuration
Create `.env.production`:
```env
# Supabase (REQUIRED)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project].supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Authentication (REQUIRED)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://indigenious.ca
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Stripe (REQUIRED for payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Email (REQUIRED for notifications)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@indigenious.ca
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@indigenious.ca

# Redis (REQUIRED for caching)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### 4. üü° Indigenous Business Verification
Current implementation needs connection to real data sources:

```typescript
// services/business/src/services/verification.ts
// NEEDS: Connection to actual Indigenous registry

interface VerificationSources {
  INAC_Registry: boolean     // Indigenous & Northern Affairs Canada
  ISC_Database: boolean      // Indigenous Services Canada  
  CCAB_Certified: boolean    // Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business
  Band_Membership: boolean   // Band council verification
}
```

**Required API Integrations:**
- [ ] Government of Canada Indigenous Business Directory API
- [ ] CCAB (Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business) API
- [ ] Provincial Indigenous registries

### 5. üü° Business Registration Flow

**Indigenous Businesses Need:**
- [ ] Band/Nation affiliation dropdown (630+ First Nations)
- [ ] Ownership percentage validation (51% Indigenous owned)
- [ ] Documentation upload (Status card, Band letter)
- [ ] Elder/Council reference option

**Canadian Businesses Need:**
- [ ] Business number validation
- [ ] Incorporation documents
- [ ] Diversity certification upload
- [ ] Payment method setup (they pay to access)

### 6. üü¢ Already Built (Needs Testing)
- ‚úÖ RFQ posting system
- ‚úÖ Bid submission logic
- ‚úÖ Matching algorithm
- ‚úÖ Email notifications
- ‚úÖ Document management
- ‚úÖ Chat system

## MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP) Features

### Phase 1: Registration & Verification (Week 1)
```javascript
// Priority endpoints to implement:
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/business/register
POST /api/business/verify
GET  /api/business/profile
```

### Phase 2: RFQ System (Week 2)
```javascript
// Core RFQ functionality:
POST /api/rfqs/create
GET  /api/rfqs/list
GET  /api/rfqs/:id
POST /api/rfqs/:id/bid
GET  /api/rfqs/:id/bids
```

### Phase 3: Payment Integration (Week 3)
```javascript
// Stripe integration:
POST /api/payments/create-subscription
POST /api/payments/webhook
GET  /api/payments/invoices
POST /api/payments/cancel
```

## üîß IMMEDIATE TECHNICAL FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Fix Service Communication
```bash
# Current issue: Services can't talk to each other
# Solution: Create docker-compose.yml for local dev
```

### 2. Consolidate Services
```bash
# Current: 8 separate services (overly complex)
# Recommended: 1 monolithic Next.js app with API routes
# Reasoning: Easier to deploy, manage, and scale initially
```

### 3. Database Schema Fixes
```sql
-- Add missing tables:
CREATE TABLE indigenous_verification (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  business_id UUID REFERENCES businesses(id),
  band_number VARCHAR(10),
  ownership_percentage INTEGER,
  verified_by VARCHAR(255),
  verified_at TIMESTAMP,
  documents JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  features JSONB,
  user_type VARCHAR(50) -- 'indigenous_sme', 'indigenous_large', 'canadian', 'government'
);
```

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended for speed)
```bash
# Deploy immediately:
vercel --prod

# Pros: 
- Zero config
- Automatic SSL
- Global CDN
- PostgreSQL included

# Cons:
- More expensive at scale
```

### Option 2: Railway.app
```bash
# One-click deploy:
railway up

# Pros:
- Easy microservices
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Good pricing

# Cons:
- Less mature
```

### Option 3: AWS (Not recommended for Sept 30)
- Too complex for tight deadline
- Requires extensive DevOps knowledge

## üìä BUSINESS MODEL IMPLEMENTATION

### Pricing Tiers (Must implement):
```javascript
const PRICING = {
  indigenous_sme: 0,        // FREE
  indigenous_large: 299,     // $299/month
  canadian_business: 499,    // $499/month  
  government: 2999,          // $2,999/month
};
```

### Access Gates:
1. **Free Tier**: Browse only, no bidding
2. **Paid Tier**: Full access, unlimited bids
3. **Government**: Post RFQs, analytics dashboard

## üõë SHOWSTOPPERS (Must Fix)

1. **No working database connection**
2. **Authentication not configured**
3. **Payment system not integrated**
4. **No Indigenous verification API**
5. **Services can't communicate**

## ‚úÖ MINIMUM LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS

To launch September 30th, you MUST have:

1. **Working authentication** (login/register)
2. **Business registration** (basic form)
3. **RFQ browsing** (public list)
4. **Payment processing** (Stripe)
5. **Basic verification** (manual review okay initially)

## üö® RECOMMENDED: SIMPLIFY ARCHITECTURE

Instead of 8 microservices, consolidate to:

```
indigenous-platform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Next.js 14 app
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/         # All API routes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (auth)/      # Auth pages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (business)/  # Business pages
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (rfq)/       # RFQ pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Shared logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma/          # Database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/          # Assets
```

This would be MUCH easier to deploy and maintain.

## NEXT STEPS (DO TODAY)

1. **Setup Supabase properly**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npx supabase init
   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

2. **Create production environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.production
   # Fill in all required values
   ```

3. **Test core flow**
   - Register business
   - Post RFQ
   - Submit bid
   - Process payment

4. **Deploy to staging**
   ```bash
   vercel --env-file=.env.production
   ```

Without these fixes, the platform cannot launch. The good news is the business logic is mostly built - it's the infrastructure that needs work.
