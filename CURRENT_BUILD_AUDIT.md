## üéØ NEXT PRIORITIES

Based on what's ACTUALLY built:

### Immediate (Can do now):
1. **Complete Business Hunter implementations**
   - Create the individual hunter classes
   - Add enrichment service
   - Add deduplication service

2. **Complete Email Service**
   - Create EmailService class
   - Create TemplateEngine class
   - Create MetricsTracker class

3. **Build RFQ Matching System**
   - Start from scratch
   - Core matching algorithm
   - API endpoints

### Waiting on External:
1. **Stripe Integration** - Needs API keys
2. **Resend Integration** - Needs API keys
3. **Production Deployment** - After testing

## üí° KEY INSIGHT

We have good FRAMEWORKS built but missing IMPLEMENTATIONS. The architecture is solid, but we need to fill in the actual service code to make things work.

**Current Reality:**
- 30% Complete implementation
- 70% Framework/structure ready
- 0% Production ready

**Time to Production:**
- 2-3 days to complete implementations
- 1 day for testing
- 1 day for deployment
- **Total: 4-5 days to launch**

---

**No more assumptions. This is what we ACTUALLY have.**
